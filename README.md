# GeneMO - Genetic Algorithm Library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukix/genemo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukix/genemo) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lukix/genemo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lukix/genemo?branch=master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/genemo.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/genemo) [![MIT Licence](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=103)](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)

Simple to use genetic algorithm library. It enables fast prototyping by providing a number of universal genetic operators (for selection, crossover, mutation, etc.) and easy customization. Supports both NodeJS and web browsers.

## Installation
```bash
npm i genemo
```

## Example Usage
Full examples with comments can be found in the [`./examples`](./examples) directory. Here is a shorter version:
```javascript
const Genemo = require('genemo');

Genemo.run({
  generateInitialPopulation: Genemo.generateInitialPopulation({
    generateIndividual, // Here, provide a function which generates an individual
    size: 200,
  }),
  selection: Genemo.selection.roulette({ minimizeFitness: false }),
  reproduce: Genemo.reproduce({
    crossover: Genemo.crossover.singlePoint(),
    mutate: Genemo.mutation.transformRandomGene(Genemo.mutation.flipBit()),
    mutationProbability: 0.02,
  }),
  evaluatePopulation: Genemo.evaluatePopulation({ fitnessFunction }), // You need to provide your own fitness function
  stopCondition: Genemo.stopCondition({ maxIterations: 100 }),
}).then(({ evaluatedPopulation }) => {
  // ...
}).catch(console.error);
```

Example of using GeneMO in the browser environment without blocking browser's main thread can be found in [genemo-web-demo](https://github.com/lukix/genemo-web-demo) repository.

## Getting Started
A single most important element of GeneMO library is a [`Genemo.run`](./API.md#genemorunoptions) function.
It runs a genetic algorithm by executing a number of user-specified functions, like for example:
generation of initial population, selection, fitness function, etc.

By providing a rich collection of universal genetic operators, GeneMO lets you build an initial
version of your genetic algorithm very quickly. Then you can refine your program by gradually
replacing GeneMO's universal genetic operators with custom, problem specific operators.

Usually, it is enough to implement a custom function for generating random individual/solution
and a fitness function. Rest of the required functions can be taken from the GeneMO library.
However, keep in mind that problem specific operators usually give better results.

Read [API Reference](#api-reference) for detailed description of all the options required by [`Genemo.run`](./API.md#genemorunoptions).<br />
See [Example Usage](#example-usage) to quickly get familiar with basic usage of GeneMO.

```javascript
Genemo.run(options).then(result => {
  // ...
});
```

[`Genemo.run`](./API.md#genemorunoptions) returns a promise, which resolves to an object:
```
{ evaluatedPopulation: EvaluatedPopulation, iteration: number, logs: object }
```
It contains information about the population (along with fitness values) from the final iteration, number of iterations and an object with logs (mostly with performance data).

### Asynchronous execution
Each function passed to [`Genemo.run`](./API.md#genemorunoptions) (`selection`, `reproduce`, `fitness`, etc.) can return a `Promise` (synchronous functions work as well).
From time to time [`Genemo.run`](./API.md#genemorunoptions) runs next iteration asynchronously to avoid blocking browser's main thread.
However, if a single iteration takes too long to complete, it will still block the main thread.
To control the frequency of asynchronous iteration executions, use `maxBlockingTime` option.

### Multithreading
Currently, GeneMO does not have a lot of functionalities for multithreading built-in, but thanks to its highly flexible architecture, you can easily implement multithreading
on your own. In the [`./examples/example3-parallelExecution`](./examples/example3-parallelExecution) directory there is a full example of a genetic algorithm, which performs fitness function and
crossover operation in parallel processes, using NodeJS [`child_process`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) module.

Usually, the most computationaly intensive elements of a genetic algorithm are fitness function, crossover and mutation.
`evaluatePopulation` parameter of `Genemo.run` is a function, which maps an array of individuals to an array of their fitness values. You can divide this array into a few chunks and evaluate each of them in parallel. To do the same with crossover and mutation, you can use [`reproduceBatch`](./API.md#genemoreproducebatch-crossoverall-mutateall-mutationprobability-)
instead of [`reproduce`](./API.md#genemoreproduce-crossover-mutate-mutationprobability-). Instead of calling the crossover function for each pair of parents,
it calls it only once, passing an array of pairs as an argument. Same with mutation - it is called only once with an array of individuals which should be mutated.
Thanks to that, you can divide those arrays into chunks an process them in parallel.

I plan to add to GeneMO more utilities that make implementing multithreading easier, but I don't want to include any code which is strictly dependend on the environment.
Therefore, things like WebWorkers or NodeJS `child_process` are not likely to appear in the library.
