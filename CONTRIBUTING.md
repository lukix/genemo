## How to contribute

Just do it! If you want to reassure yourself that your code will be merged,
you can contact me on Twitter ([@lukaszjenczmyk](https://twitter.com/lukaszjenczmyk)) before starting the work.
If you would like to contribute to this project, but you don't know what to work on, feel free to contact me as well.
Linter and tests are configured to run on the CI (and locally with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)). I appreciate your help :heart:
