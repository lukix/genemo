## How to contribute

If you found a bug, you have a feature request, or you just have a question, please open a new issue on Github.
You can also contact me on Twitter ([@lukaszjenczmyk](https://twitter.com/lukaszjenczmyk)).
Linter and tests are configured to run on the CI (and locally with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)). I appreciate your input :heart:
